## Introduction

SuitSupply is a global tailoring expert, and its backend APIs play a crucial role in delivering a seamless experience to customers. This repository provides a comprehensive suite of tests to verify the SuitSupply APIs' functionality, validate their contract, and evaluate their performance under different scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started with SuitSupply API testing, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
2. Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) if you haven't already.
3. Import the Postman collections (`Contract Testing.postman_collection.json` and `Integration Testing.postman_collection.json`) into Postman.
4. Import the workspace variables (`workspace.postman_globals.json`) into Postman.
5. Run the collections using Postman to execute the tests.

## Collections

### Contract Testing Collection

The Contract Testing collection contains tests to verify the contract between the client and the server. It validates that the API responses conform to the expected structure and behavior defined in the API contract.

### Integration Testing Collection

The Integration Testing collection contains tests to validate the functionality and behavior of various API endpoints. It simulates real-world interactions with the API to ensure that it meets the desired requirements and specifications.

## Workspace Variables

The workspace variables (`workspace.postman_globals.json`) define global variables and environment configurations used across the collections. They help maintain consistency and ease of configuration when running the tests.
